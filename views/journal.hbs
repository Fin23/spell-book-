            The world Ra-Aten - An ancient world where society's have risen and
            fallen for many a millennia. You are currently living in the year
            19,999, the new Epoch is upon us, and every kingdom, in every
            country, on every continent, across the globe is ravenous with
            prophecy and conspiracy. Many have forseen the end of the world at
            the dawn of the new year. Many of these soothsayers are simply
            phonies, frauds and snake oil sellers but some scattered across the
            globe have made predictions with uncanny accuracy with recent events
            coming to fruition, comets blazing through the sky with the bluest
            of blue tails, Volcano eruptions, resurrections, children born with
            unique abilities and markings, the appearance of miracles from one
            deity or another, you might even know of some of these events maybe
            your kingdom has sent you on a journey to discover the truth behind
            one of these.

            Mir-aq, our first main kingdom is knowns as the bridge to the west.
            Mir-aq is currently ruled by the Empress Nefer-ati who lives in the
            opulent capital city, Ankara located on the Western coast of the
            kingdom over looking the Pearl Sea. The queen treats her people
            well, slavery has been outlawed since the founding of the kingdom
            over a thousand years ago, but rumors are flying about the realm,
            whispering that the queen has surrounded her-self with witches,
            wizards and sycophants lusting for power, some even say her majesty
            has sold her soul to gain her own magical necrotic powers but no one
            can say for certain. The Empress is not married she has refused all,
            claiming that she has not found anyone worthy of her, and how can
            you blame her, her beauty is known across the globe of Ra-Aten.

            Our starting city of Kisbe is not as grand as the city of Ankara,
            but they do try, the leader of Kisbe is a man by the name of Anas he
            is both a Religious leader and Political leader with the title of
            Imam, being granted this by the Empress herself, Anas is a middle
            aged man who's main goal is to enrich Kisbe and turn it into a
            bustling and thriving city, which he is on track to do, Anas has
            turned Kisbe into a hot bed for trade, especially with one of the
            more northern cities of Tyr. In Kisbe they specialize in Textiles,
            known to create some of the most vibrant dyes in all of Mir-aq, they
            are known for their work with architecture, mostly Artistic Mosaics
            and tile work, and they have more recently become popular for a drug
            known only as spice, only the wealthiest of individuals use and
            consume spice, many say it allows you to see glimpses of your
            future, many have began traveling to Kisbe to get a taste of this
            spice. Even though Anas has brought a new level of prosperity to
            this once dusty desert town he is not with out his enemy's there are
            many that believe Anas has lost his religious ways sacrificing his
            morals for greed.

            Religion is central to Mir-aq, they follow the teachings of Un-Ma
            who is believed to be the Son of the Sun, Husband to the goddess
            Hek-ta,and the first of the gods to descend from the heavens. After
            witnessing the enslavement of his chosen people, the desert
            tribesmen, by the Kar-akis Empire, which still rules to the south
            across the pearl sea to this day. Legend tells that he road out of
            the clouds on the back of a Silver Wish Dragon known as Ankara,
            uniting the desert people and began a decade long Jihad against all
            who had enslaved the desert tribes and once all of his chosen people
            were freed they were united as one, and then he declared that
            together they would unite the world, and since that day the, Mir-aq,
            kingdom of the Sun began to grow, and eventually his initial holy
            site where Un-ma first touch down on this earth became the capital
            city Ankara, named after his treasured dragon. Legend tells that his
            dragon Ankara is still out there somewhere waiting for the return of
            her master
